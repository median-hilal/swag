# Semantic Web Analysis Graphs

Semantic Web Analysis Graphs (SWAG) allow to model and execute analytical processes for Linked Open Data (LOD). For further details, refer to the project [website](https://swag-bi.github.io/swag/).

The project ships as a Java Maven web project and can be directly imported into Eclipse or other IDEs. Once you import the project, you can build it with maven. Alternatively, you can also use the built war file in bin folder. Afterwards, the project is ready to be deployed in, e.g., Apache Tomcat.
